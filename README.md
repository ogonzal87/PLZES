#PLzes

##Overview

Hello there,

Plzes is a web application that allows you to search and store any places you would like to visit while traveling.
While traveling through Europe for 3 months with my brother, we found ourselves spending too much time planning the itinerary for the next city.
I wanted to create an application that would allow me to find the most popular places in a city and save them to my itinerary. Check it out. Is pretty cool.
